This post will contain my takeaways from section 3 of the book, including a few simple commented programs. All code snipets seen within this post are available [here](https://github.com/Jlance999/C-How-to-Program "C-How-to-Program Repo").

# III: Structured Program Development in C

The beginning of this chapter focuses a great deal on pseudocode and control structures, for practice I will be writing pseudocode to pre plan each program added to this post.
Also mentioned are control structures, namely sequence, selection and repetition, there are only seven within the base C language. I will do my best to create concrete examples of each control structure type if they are not already included in the exercises.

(float) before an assigned expression can be used to temporarily change two variables to float so their decimal places may be stored. This is known as a cast operator and can be done for most data types.

## Gas Mileage
Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One
driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording miles driven and gallons used for
each tankful. Develop a program that will input the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful.
The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each tankful. After processing 
all input information, the program should calculate and print the combined miles per gallon
obtained for all tankfuls.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  float miles;  // Initializing global variables
  float gallonsused;
  float average;

// Describing program function to user
  printf("This program will give your miles per gallon per tank, as well as an average of all tanks if you input multiple sets of data.\n\n");

 

  while(gallonsused != -1) {        //Uses -1 as sentinal to stop program, otherwise loops
    
    printf("Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): "); // Promts user for data
    scanf("%f", &gallonsused);      // Assigns data to gallonsused variable

    float totalgallons;             // Initializing local variable (only needed during loop)
    totalgallons = totalgallons + gallonsused; // Stores the sum of each gallonused entry
    
    float totalmiles;
    totalmiles = totalmiles + miles;          // Stores the sum of each miles entry

    float totalaverage;                       // Calculates miles per gallon average
    totalaverage = totalmiles / (totalgallons+1);   // Uses (totalgallons+1) to offset -1 sentinal

    if (gallonsused != -1) {
      printf("Enter the miles driven: ");   // Promts user for data
      scanf("%f", &miles);                  // Stores data to miles variable

      average = miles/gallonsused;          // Calculates miles per gallon.

      // Displays miles per gallon of current loops data.
      printf("The miles/gallon for this tank was %.3f\n\n", average); 
    }

    else {
     // Displays average miles per gallon using all data gathered from each loop.  
      printf("\nThe overall average miles/gallon was %.3f", totalaverage);
    }
  }

  return 0; // End
}
```

## Credit Limit Calculator
Develop a C program that will determine if a department store
customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account. For each customer, the following facts
are available:
a) Account number
b) Balance at the beginning of the month
c) Total of all items charged by this customer this month
d) Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month
e) Allowed credit limit
The program should input each fact, calculate the new balance (= beginning balance +
charges – credits), and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer's credit limit. For
those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the customer's account
number, credit limit, new balance and the message “Credit limit exceeded.”

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int accountNum;         // Initializing global variables
float begBalance;
float totCharges;
float totCredit;
float credLimit;
float finBalance;



int main(void) {

  while (accountNum != -1) {                          // Loop ends when user inputs -1
   printf("\nEnter account number (-1 to end): ");    // Prompting user for input
   scanf("%d", &accountNum);                          // Assigning user input to variable

    if (accountNum != -1) {                           // Only runs if user did not input -1

      printf("Enter beginning balance: ");            // Typical prompts and assignments
     scanf("%f", &begBalance);

     printf("Enter total charges: ");
     scanf("%f", &totCharges);

      printf("Enter total credits: ");
      scanf("%f", &totCredit);

    printf("Enter credit limit: ");
     scanf("%f", &credLimit);

    finBalance = begBalance + totCharges -totCredit;  // Calculating balance on account.

    if (finBalance > credLimit) {                     // Warns if charges exceed limit.
    // This looks incredibly messy but I was challenging myself to use one print statement
      printf("Account:\t\t%d\nCredit limit:\t%.2f\nBalance:\t\t%.2f\nCredit Limit Exceeded.\n",accountNum, credLimit, finBalance);
     }
   }
  }
  return 0;   // End
}
```

## Printing Numbers from a Loop
Write a program that utilizes looping to print the numbers from 1 to 10 side by side on the same line with three spaces between numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

  int x = 1;
  
  while (x<=10) {
    printf("%d   ",x);
	
	x++;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Probably the easiest program since hello world, but it was the first time I found a use for incrementing in an exercise so I did it for
the sake of practice.

## Find the Largest Number
The process of finding the largest number (i.e., the maximum
of a group of numbers) is used frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that
determines the winner of a sales contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson.
The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest. Write a pseudocode program and then a
program that inputs a series of 10 non-negative numbers and determines and prints the largest of
the numbers. Hint: Your program should use three variables as follows:
counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have
been input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed)
number: The current number input to the program
largest: The largest number found so far

### Pseudocode:
initialize variable largest
prompt for numbers
scan user input
if larger than previous number, save to variable, discard otherwise
	repeat until 10 numbers have been entered
	
print variable

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  unsigned int largest;       // Initializing global variable, unsigned, no negative #
  int counter = 1;                  // Initializing global counter variable
  
  // Explaining program function to user.
  printf("This program will compare 10 positive integer and output the largest.\n\n");

  // Loop running 10 times
  while (counter <= 10) {
    int number;                    // Initializing local variable

    printf("Please enter value %d: ", counter);   // Prompting user for input
    scanf("%d", &number);                        // Stores value to temporary variable x 
    
    // Compares the current x with the stored largest value, and stores whichever is largest
    if (number > largest) {
      largest = number;
    }

    counter++;  // Keeping track of number of loops.
  }

  printf("\nLargest value given is %d\n", largest); // Prints largest value.

  return 0;
}
```

I liked this exercise because it made me write my program out in pseudocode before starting, 
put a nested if statement into action and allowed me to make use of incrementing again.  I 
also took the liberty of using my counter in my printouts as we had to in the previous program 
because it made sense to keep track of how many values had been entered visually.
Simple, clean program.

## Finding the Two Largest Numbers
Using an approach similar to Exercise 3.23, find the two
largest values of the 10 numbers. [Note: You may input each number only once.]

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/*
 Using an approach similar to Exercise 3.23, find the two
largest values of the 10 numbers. [Note: You may input each number only once.]
*/

int main(void) {
  unsigned int largest;       // Initializing global variable, unsigned, no negative #
  unsigned int secondLargest;
  int counter = 1;                  // Initializing global counter variable
  
  // Explaining program function to user.
  printf("This program will compare 10 positive integer and output the largest.\n\n");

  // Loop running 10 times
  while (counter <= 10) {
    int number;                    // Initializing local variable

    printf("Please enter value %d: ", counter);   // Prompting user for input
    scanf("%d", &number);                        // Stores value to temporary variable x 
    
    // Compares the current x with the stored largest value, and stores whichever is largest
    if (number > largest) {
      secondLargest = largest;    // Stores current largest value as second largest
      largest = number;           // Stores new value as largest value
    }

    // In case the number is not the largest but is larger than current second largest
    if (number > secondLargest && number!= largest) {
      secondLargest = number;     
    }
    counter++;  // Keeping track of number of loops.
  }

  printf("\nLargest value given is %d\n", largest); // Prints largest value.
  printf("Second largest value given is %d\n", secondLargest); // Prints second largest


  return 0;
}
```

There is no reason not to re-use my previous code for this so using the previous program
so I did so here as an example on how to iterate on previous code to get new results.

## Square of Asterisks

Write a program that reads in the side of a square and then prints that
square out of asterisks. Your program should work for squares of all side sizes between 1 and 20.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int size;         // Initializing global variables
  int counter=0;

  // Explaining program function to user
  printf("This program will print a square in the size of your choosing, size is measured in number of characters across, any size from 1-20 is accepted.\n\n");

  printf("What size square would you like? ");  // Prompting user for input
  scanf("%d", &size);                           // Assigning input to size variable

  while(counter <= size) {                      // Will loop [size] times
    int counter2 = 0;                           // Resets counter for second loop to 0

   while (counter2 <= size) {                   // Outputs "* " [size] times
     printf("* ");

     counter2++;
   }
   printf("\n");                                // Moves output to new line

   counter++;                                   // Increments counter
  }
  return 0; // End
}
```

To be honest I have skipped quite a few exercises thus far, especially those that seemed to use things
I already used in previous exercises, but just organized them trivially in another way. I decided to do 
this one because it seemed interesting even though it was basically text formatting again.

So after starting this program I realized it was one I had to ask for help with in my Intro to C course
and it did take me 3-4 extra minutes to figure out but its honestly so rewarding doing it correctly 
these years later, I will go ahead and try one more similar problem just to drill the work home.

## Hollow Square of Asterisks
Modify the program you wrote in Exercise 3.32 so that it
prints a hollow square.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int size;         // Initializing global variables
  int counter=1;

  // Explaining program function to user
  printf("This program will print a hollow square of asterisks in the size of your choosing, 
  size is measured in number of characters across, any size from 1-20 is accepted.\n\n");

  printf("What size square would you like? ");  // Prompting user for input
  scanf("%d", &size);                           // Assigning input to size variable

  while(counter <= size) {                      // Will loop [size] times
    int counter2 = 0;                           // Resets counter for second loop to 0

    if(counter == 1 || counter == size) {       // Only runs the first and last line.
     while (counter2 < size) {                  // Outputs "* " [size] times
      printf("* ");

      counter2++;                               // Increments counter
      }
    }

    else {
      int counter3 = 0;                         // Initializing local counter
      printf("* ");                             // Prints first two characters of inner
      while (counter3 <= (size-3)) {            // Accounts for the 3 characters outside
        printf("  ");
        counter3++;                             // Increments counter for spaces in inner
      }
      printf("*");                              // Prints last character of inner lines
    }
   printf("\n");                                // Moves output to new line

   counter++;                                   // Increments counter
  }
  return 0; // End
}
```

I was honestly surprised by how many nested loops I needed for this, maybe the way I did it is inneficient, 
however I really enjoyed this exercise. The core change here is just forming logic for when to print different
lines. I realized I only needed my previous loop during the first and last lines so I set up an if loop to run it
the first line and the [size] line, allowing it to scale and know based on the user input where to print itself.
I simply printed the middle lines every loop that I was not printing the first and last lines, determining its 
output using the size variable much in the way I did with the original program, but subtracting 3 characters from it 
so I could print the first asterisk and space and asterisk after outside of the loop.

## How Fast is Your Computer?
How can you determine how fast your own computer really
operates? Write a program with a while loop that counts from 1 to 1,000,000,000 by 1s. Every time
the count reaches a multiple of 100,000,000, print that number on the screen. Use your watch to
time how long each 100 million repetitions of the loop takes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int counter = 0;  // Initializing counter variable

  while (counter <= 1000000000) {       // Loops 1 billion times
    if ((counter % 100000000) == 0) {   // Prints any number divisible by 100 million
      printf("%d\n", counter);
    }
    counter++;                          // Ups counter by 1 per loop
  }
  return 0;   // end
}
```

Example Output:

Not much garnered from this program to be honest, it was very simple I just hadn't previously used the remainder
operator.
