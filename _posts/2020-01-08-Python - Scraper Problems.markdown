So I was working on the GUI for the Amazon Scraper today, and was doing some small things to make it more stylistic/intuitive, at this point just trying to pull the scraped product title into the graph as the graph title instead of it simply reading "Live Graph" for a heading. While doing so I suddenly had this error occur:

```
    title = soup2.find(id= "productTitle").get_text()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_text'
```

I thought, alright, fair enough, I'll just revert to my last working implementation and compare the changes to see what went wrong. I did so, and got the same error. I thought maybe there was an update to Amazon's website, maybe it was now loaded in differently, or the variable I was looking for had had a name change, so I checked.

Alright, the variable is the same, maybe its just being loaded in differently and I need to add a delay to the scraper or something else trivial, as I learned from my troubleshooting background, its usually logical to check for the most obvious possible issues and work my way down. Instead of adding a delay, I first checked to see if the html itself was even being parsed, to do this I simply added ```print(soup)``` on the line just before the error occured. This is where things got interesting.

Amazon bot detection found us out! The shame. Now what? Do we just abandon our poor scraper who didn't even make it to a full useable program outside of the terminal? Do we chalk it up to a learning experience and move on? Absolutely not. The entire reason I took the time to do this project in the first place was to learn about Python, and hopefully build my first GUI driven application after all of the C projects schoolwork has haunted my nightmares with. I need a break from plugging algorithms into those unforgiving black and white screens, and I'm not ready for that break to be over. I have spent the morning mulling over this issue, and the possible ways to move forward.

# Manipulate the Header

I could simply change my header and restore the full funcitonality of the program.

## Pros
+ Easy
+ Restores full functionality of previously written code
+ Allows me to immediately go back to learning tkinter

 
## Cons
+ This issue could re-arise in the future
+ Amazon's servers probably hate web scrapers 
+ Increases maintenance needs of program moving forward
